# Azure Blob Storage Configuration
# ================================
# IMPORTANT: You need the CONNECTION STRING, not the container URL!
#
# Your container URL looks like: https://youraccountname.blob.core.windows.net/containername
# But you need the CONNECTION STRING from Azure Portal:
#
# How to get your connection string:
#   1. Go to Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)
#   2. Navigate to: Storage Accounts -> pawsvillepromptshop (your storage account)
#   3. In the left sidebar, click "Access keys" under "Security + networking"
#   4. Click "Show" next to "Connection string" for key1
#   5. Copy the entire connection string
#
# The connection string looks like:
#   DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=pawsvillepromptshop;AccountKey=xxxxxx==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
#
# Without this connection string, the app will fall back to LOCAL STORAGE mode
# (data stored in browser localStorage, lost when browser data is cleared)
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=

# Optional: App URL for deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
